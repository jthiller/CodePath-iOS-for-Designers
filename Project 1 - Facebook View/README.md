* **How many hours did it take to complete?**
  * It took roughly 10 hours for me to finish this project. Time was spent on-and-off, so it is a little difficult to determine for this project.
* **Which required and optional stories have you completed?**
  *  ~~*Add a container view and modify properties: backgroundColor, cornerRadius, font, textColor, shadowOffset.*~~
  *  ~~*Add buttons with different images for default and highlighted.*~~
  *  ~~*Add UIImageViews and choose the right mode: aspect fill, aspect fit, etc.*~~
  *  ~~*Add a UITextField with a background image.*~~
  *  ~~*Add UILabels with attributed text (instead of plain text), so that you can bold individual words.*~~
  *  *Setup CocoaPods for managing 3rd party libraries and use TTTAttributedLabel to style the link and make it clickable*

  *  *Optional: Move the textfield when the keyboard appears*
